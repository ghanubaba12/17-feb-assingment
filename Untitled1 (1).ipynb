    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database that is designed to store unstructured data. Unlike relational databases that use tables with pre-defined schemas, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it easier to store and retrieve data that may not fit neatly into a tabular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not rely on a traditional relational model of data, where data is organized into tables with a pre-defined schema. Instead, they use flexible data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph models, to store data in a more flexible and scalable way. Non-relational databases are often preferred for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, which may be difficult to model using a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios where MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling large volumes of unstructured data: MongoDB's document-oriented data model makes it well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured data, such as log files, social media posts, and sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, making it easier to handle large amounts of data by distributing it across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: MongoDB's flexible data model makes it easy to add or remove fields from documents without disrupting the application, which is particularly useful in agile development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: MongoDB's architecture allows for fast and efficient queries, making it well-suited for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-based applications: MongoDB is often preferred for cloud-based applications due to its ability to scale horizontally and its support for distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a popular choice for applications that require flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "ansMongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that offers a range of features designed to make it easy to store, retrieve, and manage data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, which means that data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents rather than tables with fixed schemas. This allows for more flexible data modeling and makes it easier to store and retrieve complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for easy and flexible data modeling, as documents can be updated with new fields without having to modify the entire schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing on any field, including nested fields and arrays, which allows for fast query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying: MongoDB supports a range of querying options, including aggregation, map-reduce, and text search, making it easy to retrieve data in the format that is most useful for a particular application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle large volumes of data by distributing it across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, which means that it can distribute data across multiple servers in a cluster without requiring manual configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB supports replication, which allows for data to be automatically replicated across multiple servers for increased reliability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB's GridFS allows for the storage of large files, such as images and videos, directly in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise-grade security: MongoDB offers enterprise-grade security features, including role-based access control, SSL/TLS encryption, and auditing.\n",
